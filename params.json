You can host your own server and you just need to send the IP-address and port to the other users.\r\nThe messages are encrypted so you can chat safe.\r\nYou can chat in groupchat and privatechat\r\n\r\nThe program is written in java since this is the programming language we are most common with. Our focus is to get contributers to the project so that everyone can share opinions and experiences.\r\n\r\nThe project is Open Source and everyone can join. Just Fork the project and send in a pull request!\r\n\r\nThe project was started by:\r\n@Khomme @vetlaf12 @realbunny\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
