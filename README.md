# Getting started


Afther you have downloaded the source files, you should start by going FreeleServer.java, 
here you should find the server socket on line 183:

```java
ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(4000);

```

You should change this to your choise of the port you want to use, remeber to port forward to wich computer is using running the server. We don't go trough how to open a port but you can find plenty of guides on the internett.
